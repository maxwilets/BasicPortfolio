<p>My name is Max Wilets. I am a current student enrolled in the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I am a recent graduate from the University
    of Utah with my Bachelor's of Science in Geography with an emphasis in GIS and Ecology. 
</p>
<p> My acedemic interests include developing GeoTools and using spatial analysis to improve enviornmental provisions in growing city dynamics. I have an interest in oceanic environments
    and hopefully on day I can study oceanography! When I 
    am not working or in school you can find my at the skate park, playing video games, or playing with my cat "Pancakes".
    I am a big fan of music and my pallet extends across all the genres. I am also a huge fan of podcasts, some
    of my favorites are: "Jordan Jesse Go!", "Story Break", "The Adventure Zone", "My Brother My Brother and ME"
    "The Flop House", and "Wolf 359". I am working towards starting a podast of my one, hopefully one day 
    in the near future you will be able to hear it.
